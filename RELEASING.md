# Releasing Manul

After the acceptance gates below pass, a pushed tag starts CI. Windows support is configured, but has not
yet been validated on a native runner or published. Missing Windows signing configuration intentionally
blocks the entire public release; there is no unsigned Windows fallback.

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` then:
1. builds on five native runners (macOS arm64 + Intel, Linux x64 + arm64, Windows x64): bundled whisper.cpp, pinned ffmpeg, packaging tests, typecheck and runtime unit tests; Windows also runs selected runtime E2E and the native whisper Unicode-path regression;
2. packages, **signs and notarizes** the Mac app (when the Apple secrets exist); then one job merges the two Mac update feeds and publishes `.dmg`, `.zip`,
   `.deb`, AppImage, signed Windows NSIS `.exe`, blockmaps and the `latest*.yml` update files to **GitHub Releases** — this is what installed apps update from;
3. rebuilds and signs the **apt repository** and pushes its small metadata files to the `apt` branch (when `APT_GPG_KEY_ID` is set). Cloudflare Pages serves that branch; `.deb` downloads redirect to GitHub Releases.

When `resources/skills/**` changes on main, `.github/workflows/skills.yml` signs the **skills feed**
(`updates/skills.json`), which installed apps pick up within 6 hours — no app release needed.

## One-time setup (owner)

| What | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The `hormuz-labs/manul` repository | GitHub | code, releases (the update feed), the skills feed |
| Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) | developer.apple.com | signing + notarization; Homebrew drops casks Gatekeeper blocks |
| `MAC_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `MAC_CERT_PASSWORD` | repo secrets | "Developer ID Application" certificate (.p12, base64) |
| `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | repo secrets | notarization |
| `WINDOWS_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` | repo secrets | Windows Authenticode certificate (.p12/.pfx, base64) and password, passed as `WIN_CSC_LINK` / `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` |
| `WINDOWS_PUBLISHER_NAME` | repo variable | Exact certificate publisher common name, case-sensitive. Injected into `win.signtoolOptions.publisherName` and the packaged updater configuration; do not guess it from the product or company name |
| `MANUL_SKILLS_KEY` | repo secret | contents of `~/.config/manul/skills-signing.pem` (Ed25519 private key; its public half ships in `resources/skills-public.pem`). Keep a backup: a lost key means shipping a new public key in an app release |
| `hormuz-labs/homebrew-tap` repository | GitHub | `brew install hormuz-labs/tap/manul`. Its own workflow checks Manul's releases hourly and rewrites the cask with `scripts/homebrew-cask.mjs` from the release tag, so no token is shared ("Run workflow" there to update at once) |
| Cloudflare Pages project tracking the `apt` branch | Cloudflare | Only package lists, signatures, public key and redirects are stored in git; large `.deb` files stay on GitHub Releases |
| `APT_GPG_KEY_ID` (variable), `APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` (secret) | repo settings | apt metadata signing; no R2 bucket/access-key configuration is used by the current workflow |
| `apt.manul.si` custom domain on that Pages project | DNS | the line users add to their sources |

Without the Apple secrets, releases still build but the Mac app is unsigned: the cask clears the quarantine flag for Homebrew users, and anyone downloading the .dmg directly must right-click → Open.

## Windows packaging

Windows requires a **native x64 Windows runner** and Node >=22.19.0, not Linux cross-compilation:
electron-builder's `${platform}` macro selects host resources. `beforePack` rejects mismatched targets.
The **offline one-click NSIS installer** is per-user, cannot elevate or switch to per-machine, and has no
licence-acceptance or directory-selection wizard. Users open one `.exe`; it installs to their per-user
Programs directory, creates Desktop/Start menu shortcuts, and launches Manul. No repository setup,
package manager or developer prerequisites are required. `LICENSE` remains bundled, not an installer page.
The app and core tool executables are in the installer, not fetched by a web bootstrapper; speech models
and optional heavier tools are downloaded inside the app on request. App data survives uninstall.
Silent `/S` installs do not auto-launch; `/D=<path>` remains available for isolated CI installation.
Requires **Windows 10 version 1903 (build 18362) or newer / Windows 11 x64**.
Artifact: `Manul-${version}-windows-x64-Setup.exe`; updater feed: `latest.yml`, with its `.exe.blockmap`.

```powershell
npm ci
npm run build:whisper
npm run test:packaging
npm run package
node test/e2e/packaged.e2e.mjs
```

No signing secrets are needed for local/PR **test-only** builds. For optional local signing, provide all
three environment variables: `WIN_CSC_LINK` (base64 or certificate path), `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`,
`WINDOWS_PUBLISHER_NAME`. Partial signing configuration is an error. Public CI sets
`MANUL_PUBLIC_RELEASE=1`, requires those values before downloading/building, and forces code signing.
The release lane verifies valid, timestamped Authenticode signatures on both app and installer, checks
the exact signer against `WINDOWS_PUBLISHER_NAME`, and confirms the updater embeds that exact name.
Do not disable `verifyUpdateCodeSignature` or use an empty publisher list to unblock a release.
If the certificate requires hardware-backed/cloud signing rather than an exportable PFX, configure and
validate that signing provider before releasing; that alternative is not implemented here.

CI builds whisper.cpp v1.9.4 using CMake/Visual Studio 2022 x64, `/MT`, no OpenMP or dynamic GGML backends,
and an explicit SSE2 baseline. A Manul-owned CMake wrapper adds an **embedded UTF-8 activeCodePage
manifest**, leaving the pinned upstream checkout unchanged. Windows 10 1903/build 18362 is the first
version honoring this process code page. This makes MSVC's narrow CLI arguments, input file checks,
audio decoding and JSON/TXT/SRT file writes consistent with upstream's UTF-8-to-wide model loading,
including non-ASCII user profiles. It does not require the system-wide UTF-8 locale setting.
`build:whisper` and the dependency inspection verify PE manifest resource #1 with Windows SDK `mt.exe`;
the build identity invalidates pre-manifest cached whisper binaries.

The existing native Windows `test:packaging` CI step downloads only the pinned multilingual base model
(SHA-256 `60ed5bc3dd14eea856493d334349b405782ddcaf0028d4b5df4088345fba2efe`) into a temporary
Unicode/space/`[]` profile-like model directory, writes its installed metadata, and transcribes real fixture
speech with Unicode/`[]` input and JSON/TXT/SRT output paths. The JSON must echo the exact model path and
all three outputs must contain recognized speech. Local acceptance can supply the same checksummed model
with `MANUL_TEST_WHISPER_MODEL`, or run `node scripts/smoke-whisper-paths.mjs --download-model` explicitly.
This is a native CLI regression, not a claim that full app/profile acceptance is complete.

`check-windows-dependencies.ps1` uses MSVC `dumpbin` on all four bundled
executables, rejects unaccounted VC++/OpenMP/compiler runtime DLL imports, and fails on missing non-system DLLs.
The pinned BSK binary does import `VCRUNTIME140.dll`: `build:whisper` copies the VS2022 x64 redistributable
from `VCToolsRedistDir` or the installed Visual Studio redist directory into bundled `bin/`. CI verifies
its Microsoft signature and imports. Whisper itself may not import VC++/OpenMP DLLs. Never copy a
DLL from a developer's System32, and review Visual Studio's redistribution terms before public shipment.
This dependency inspection and a developer runner are not substitutes for a clean-PC test.

The Windows PR/release lanes run packaged E2E, then install silently into a temporary directory with spaces
using the one-click installer's `/D` override (last and unquoted), verify Desktop/Start menu shortcut targets,
verify the **installed** whisper UTF-8 manifest, run E2E against the **installed** app, and uninstall/check
HKCU registration and shortcut removal. `/S`
suppresses normal auto-launch so E2E owns the test process. This smoke is restricted to
disposable GitHub-hosted Windows runners and refuses an existing Manul installation. It uses the runner's
real, disposable user profile; changing `USERPROFILE` alone would not isolate NSIS registry/shortcuts.
Never run it against a developer profile. The workflow has not been exercised yet.

## Windows acceptance gates

- Native Windows PR lane green: fetch pins/layout, MSVC build, embedded UTF-8 manifest, real-model Unicode/`[]` transcription, dependency inspection, typecheck, packaging tests, runtime unit/E2E suites, packaged E2E, one-click install/uninstall smoke.
- Clean Windows 10 **1903/build 18362 or newer** / Windows 11 x64 VM with a non-ASCII account name, legacy system locale (system-wide UTF-8 option OFF), and no developer tools, Git Bash, FFmpeg, Python or VC++ Redistributable: open the offline installer as a standard user; verify no wizard/elevation, Desktop/Start menu shortcuts, automatic first launch/uninstall, DPAPI key storage, Unicode/space/`[]` paths and no leaked child processes after close. A current supported Windows release is recommended; the encoding floor alone is not full OS acceptance.
- Exercise import/proxy/thumbnail, motion clips, playback/audio, caption burn-in, bundled whisper transcription/model download, export, private BrowserSkill daemon/extension, PowerShell agent commands and optional Python tools. CPU-only whisper and no Windows ARM64/32-bit installer are intentional.
- Signed staging build trusted on a clean VM: inspect publisher and timestamp, verify both app and installer signatures and installer UX. SmartScreen reputation may still warn even with a valid signature; do not promise its absence.
- Two **signed** versions using a private/staging GitHub update feed: installed N discovers N+1 through `latest.yml`, downloads correct x64 installer, verifies publisher, applies update, restarts and preserves projects/settings. A tampered installer or a valid signature from a different publisher must be rejected. Feed existence or an update-check error alone is not update acceptance.
- Preserve corresponding source and third-party notices for the exact Gyan FFmpeg build (including library versions/configuration in the bundled `bin/ffmpeg-README.txt`) before public distribution.
- Manually update the external **manul.si** download/install/support pages only after acceptance. Its source is absent from this repository and was not updated here.
