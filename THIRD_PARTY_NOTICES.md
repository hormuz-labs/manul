# Third-party software shipped with Manul

## FFmpeg 9.0.2 (ffmpeg, ffprobe)

Manul runs FFmpeg as separate programs; it does not link against it.

- **Licence:** GNU General Public License v3 (this build is configured with `--enable-gpl --enable-version3` and
  includes libx264, libx265, libass, vid.stab, Rubber Band and others).
- **Builds:** static binaries built by `scripts/ffmpeg/build.sh` (Martin Riedl's build script,
  https://git.martin-riedl.de/ffmpeg/build-script, Apache-2.0, at a pinned commit, plus Manul's modules for the two
  libraries below), published as the repository's `ffmpeg-*` prereleases and pinned by SHA-256 in
  `scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs`.
- **Source:** https://ffmpeg.org/download.html (release 9.0.2). Each library's version is pinned in the build script's
  `version/` folder and downloaded from its project. On request we will also provide the exact sources for the binaries we ship.
- **vid.stab 1.1.2** (libvidstab, camera shake detection and stabilisation): GPL-2.0-or-later,
  https://github.com/georgmartius/vid.stab.
- **Rubber Band 4.0.0** (librubberband, time-stretching and pitch-shifting): GPL-2.0-or-later,
  https://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/.

## aubio (manul-beats)

GPL-3.0-or-later, https://aubio.org, https://github.com/aubio/aubio (master at a pinned commit, see
`scripts/build-beats.sh`). Its sources are compiled with Manul's small CLI (`scripts/beats/manul-beats.c`, under the same
licence) into the separate `manul-beats` program, which Manul runs to find tempo, beats and onsets in music.

## whisper.cpp v1.9.4 (whisper-cli)

MIT licence, https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp. Built statically by `scripts/build-whisper.sh` (Metal embedded on
macOS). The model (ggml-base, MIT, from huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) is downloaded on first use, SHA-256 checked.

## BrowserSkill 0.3.2 (bsk CLI, its Chrome extension, its agent skill)

MIT licence, Copyright (c) 2026 Tencent, https://github.com/Tencent/BrowserSkill. Release binaries and the extension
package are pinned by SHA-256 in `scripts/fetch-bsk.mjs`; the agent skill (`skills/browser-skill`) is copied from the
same release with only its description changed. Manul runs the extension unmodified inside its own browser.

## Inter 4.1 (font)

SIL Open Font License 1.1, https://github.com/rsms/inter. Used for clip typography (woff2, via @fontsource-variable/inter)
and for burned-in captions (`Inter-Regular.ttf`, `Inter-Bold.ttf` from the v4.1 release; licence in `lib/fonts/Inter-LICENSE.txt`).

## Tools downloaded on demand

Downloaded only after the user agrees, into Manul's own folder: uv (Apache-2.0/MIT), faster-whisper (MIT),
Whisper models (MIT).
