# Word-by-word captions with an .ass file

Tested with Manul's bundled ffmpeg (libass). Write the file with the write tool into the project (e.g.
`renders/captions.ass`), then burn it in the same ffmpeg command as the rest of the edit.

- `Caption`: Inter Bold 86 px, white, 7 px black outline + soft shadow, bottom-centred (Alignment 2) with its baseline
  560 px above the bottom (≈ 71 % of the height: above the platforms' bottom zone).
- `Hook`: white text on a black box (BorderStyle 3), top-centred (Alignment 8), 300 px from the top (below the top zone).
- Colours are `&HAABBGGRR` in styles and `&HBBGGRR&` in `{\c…}` overrides: yellow #FFD700 → `&H00D7FF&`,
  white → `&HFFFFFF&`, brand colour #RRGGBB → `&HBBGGRR&`.
- For 1920×1080 (horizontal) set PlayResX 1920, PlayResY 1080, Fontsize ~64, Caption MarginV ~90.

## 2. Building the events from the transcript
- Group the words into chunks of 1–3 words (break at punctuation and natural phrases; never split a name or number).
- For each word in a chunk, one Dialogue line from that word's start to the next word's start (the last word of a chunk:
  to its end + 0.15 s, or the next chunk's start if sooner), showing the whole chunk with that word coloured.
- Times are `H:MM:SS.cc` (hundredths) **on the edited timeline**: after cutting, shift every word time by where its
  kept range landed. Easiest: build captions from the transcript of the cut (`transcript` on the render), then burn in
  a second, fast pass that copies the audio (`-c:a copy`).
- Upper-case for punchy social style, or sentence case for calmer content; strip fillers ("um", "uh") from captions.
- Escape `{`, `}` and `\` in caption text (or remove them).

## 3. Burning it
```bash
ffmpeg -y -i renders/cut.mp4 -vf "subtitles=f=renders/captions.ass:fontsdir=<the fonts folder from your instructions>" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a copy -movflags +faststart renders/captioned.mp4
```
Then `look` at 2–3 moments: the highlighted word is the one being said, nothing covers a face, everything is inside the
safe zones.
