# Tutorials, demos and screen recordings

A tutorial is judged by one thing: can the viewer follow and repeat it? Clarity beats style. Read video-editing first;
talking-head for the voice; motion-design for callouts and titles.

## 1. Know the recording
- `analyze_video`: screen recordings show as long low-motion shots with frozen stretches (waiting, reading) — those are
  candidates to cut or speed up. `transcript`: what is explained when. `look` at frames to see what's on screen (the app,
  where the cursor is, the text size).
- Ask in one card only what changes the edit (video-editing's briefs.md): who it's for (beginners → slower, more zoom;
  experts → faster), where it goes (YouTube 16:9, a course, docs, social clip), how tight.

## 2. Cutting
- **Remove**: waiting (loading, rendering, installs), mistakes and their undo, searching for the right menu, "uh, let me
  just…", repeated attempts, dead time at the start and end. Keep the moment a step completes.
- **Speed up** what must be seen but is slow: typing long text, scrolling, progress bars, repetitive steps → 2–8× (use
  `setpts` for picture; mute or drop the audio of sped-up parts, or keep the voice at normal speed by cutting it
  separately). Show a small "2×"/"⏩" label if the speed-up could confuse.
- **Never cut** a step the viewer needs to repeat it: the click on the menu item, the value typed, the setting changed.
  When in doubt, keep the step and speed it up.
- Voice: cut fillers and long pauses (talking-head), but keep the voice in sync with what's on screen — if the narration
  describes a click, the click must be visible while it's said. Reorder nothing that changes the steps' order.

## 3. Zoom (the most important tool)
- Zoom into the area where the action happens whenever text or controls would be too small to read on a phone or a
  laptop: crop to that region (keep 16:9), scale back to the output size. Typical zoom 150–250 %.
- **Ease in and out** over 0.4–0.6 s (never a jump), hold while the action happens, zoom back out when the viewer needs
  the whole screen again (to find where they are). One zoom per step; don't wander.
- Keep the zoom ≤ the source resolution's limit: on a 1080p recording, 200 % already looks soft; on 4K/retina, 200–300 %
  stays sharp.
- Readability rule: UI text should be at least ~1.5 % of the frame height (≈ 16 px on 1080p) after zoom; code at least
  ~2 % (≈ 22 px). If it isn't, zoom more or crop.
- Vertical (9:16) clips of a screen: crop to the part that matters, never shrink the whole screen into the middle.

## 4. Callouts and text
- Highlight what to click with a box, a circle or an arrow (motion-design overlay), appearing 0.2–0.3 s before the click
  and leaving after it. One callout at a time.
- Keyboard shortcuts and typed values as small text labels ("⌘ + K") at the bottom while they happen.
- Step titles ("Step 2 — Connect the database") as a short lower-third or a card at each step's start.
- Blur or crop anything private on screen (emails, API keys, names, notifications) — look for it with `look` and ask
  the user if you see something that may be private.

## 5. Webcam overlay (if there is a face recording)
- A circle or rounded rectangle in a corner that doesn't cover the action (move it when the action is in that corner),
  15–25 % of the frame width. Full-screen face for the intro, the outro and personal moments; the screen for the steps.

## 6. Structure
- Result first (3–10 s: what you'll be able to do) → what you need → steps in order (each: say what and why, then do it)
  → the result again → recap. Chapters at each step for videos over ~3 minutes (`0:00 Title` lines in your reply).
- Courses: one lesson per topic, 3–10 minutes, same intro/outro style each time.

## 7. Before proposing
- Every step can be followed: watch the cut at each step (`look` at its frames): the click, the typed value and the
  result are visible and readable.
- Zooms ease in and out; no text too small; nothing private visible.
- Narration in sync with the screen; no cut inside a word; loudness -14 LUFS (-16 for courses with long listening is ok).
