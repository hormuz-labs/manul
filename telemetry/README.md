# Crash reports and usage statistics

Manul asks once, on first run, with two boxes that start **unticked**:

- **Send crash reports**: crashes and errors go to [Sentry](https://sentry.io).
- **Share usage statistics**: a short, fixed list of events goes to [PostHog](https://posthog.com) through Manul's
  proxy.

Closing the dialog counts as no to both. Either can be changed at any time in **Settings → About**, and the change
takes effect at once. Builds made from source never ask and send nothing, because the addresses below are only set
in release builds.

## What is never sent

Your footage, file or folder names, paths, project titles, prompts, agent replies, transcripts, API keys, or URLs.
Users' IP addresses are not passed on to PostHog. Sentry is told not to keep them.

## Usage statistics

Every event and property is listed in [`src/shared/telemetry.ts`](../src/shared/telemetry.ts). The app drops
anything else, and the proxy rebuilds each event from the same list and refuses anything that isn't on it.

| Event | Properties |
|---|---|
| `app opened` | none |
| `project created` | none |
| `active time` | `seconds` of use while Manul is focused and you are not idle (sent in steps of at least a minute) |
| `agent run` | `provider` and `model` used, `tools`: the names of Manul's tools it called, `toolCalls`, `ok`, `seconds` |
| `version decided` | `accepted`: whether you kept the version the agent proposed |
| `export finished` | `preset` (original, landscape, vertical, square), `captions` (none, srt, burn), `by` (user or agent), `ok`, `seconds` |
| `tool installed` | `tool` (e.g. whisper), `ok` |

Every event also carries `app_version`, `os`, `arch`, and a random installation ID that is not tied to you. Saying no
deletes anything unsent and the ID, and saying yes again starts a new one. Events wait on disk while offline (at most
500) and are retried with the same IDs, so they are not counted twice.

## Crash reports

Sentry's Electron SDK reports native crashes of the app and its windows, and uncaught errors in the main process
and the interface. To keep your data out of reports:

- local variable values, console output, network requests and screenshots are switched off;
- file paths in error messages are replaced with `<path>`;
- the computer's name and user details are removed.

The SDK runs in release builds either way, but nothing is sent unless crash reports are ticked. A crash from before
you said yes is never sent later. See [`src/main/crash.ts`](../src/main/crash.ts).

## How the pieces fit

```
Manul ── usage batches ──▶ analytics.manul.si (Cloudflare Worker, telemetry/proxy) ──▶ PostHog
Manul ── crash reports ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────▶ Sentry
GitHub Actions, daily (telemetry/github-stats.mjs) ── downloads, stars, forks, clones ──▶ PostHog
```

- **Proxy** ([`proxy/worker.ts`](proxy/worker.ts)). It accepts only `POST /batch/` for Manul's PostHog project,
  limits each IP to 30 batches a minute, and passes on nothing from the request but the cleaned events.
- **Dashboards** are made in PostHog. There is no server of ours to run.
- **GitHub numbers** come from [`.github/workflows/github-stats.yml`](../.github/workflows/github-stats.yml) as one
  `github snapshot` event a day. Installer downloads are GitHub's `download_count` for `.dmg`, `.deb` and `.AppImage`
  files: requests, not people or completed installs. Clone counts cover GitHub's rolling 14 days and need a token
  with push access.

## Setting it up

1. **PostHog.** Create a project. Note its project token (`phc_…`, public by design: it can only send events) and its
   region's capture host (`https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`).
2. **Proxy.** Put the token and host in [`proxy/wrangler.toml`](proxy/wrangler.toml). Then, from `telemetry/proxy`,
   run `npx wrangler deploy`. It serves `analytics.manul.si`, so remove that name's old tunnel route first.
3. **Sentry.** Create an Electron project and note its DSN. For readable stack traces, also create an auth token
   that can upload source maps.
4. **GitHub repository settings.**
   - Variables: `MANUL_TELEMETRY_URL=https://analytics.manul.si`, `MANUL_POSTHOG_TOKEN`, `MANUL_SENTRY_DSN`,
     `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, and for the daily snapshot `POSTHOG_TOKEN` and `POSTHOG_HOST`.
   - Secrets: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, and optionally `GH_TRAFFIC_TOKEN` for clone counts.

   The release workflow builds them in. Hidden source maps are uploaded to Sentry and then deleted, so they never
   ship in the app.

Tests: `npm test -- test/telemetry.test.ts`.
